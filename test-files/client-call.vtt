00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Account Manager>Thank you for joining us today. We're excited to review Phase 1 results.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Client Stakeholder>We're very pleased with the deliverables. Everything was on time and high quality.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Project Lead>I'm glad to hear that. For Phase 2, we'd like to propose an expanded scope.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Client Stakeholder>What are you thinking? We have budget for additional features.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Project Lead>We recommend adding a mobile companion app. It would extend the platform to iOS and Android.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Client Stakeholder>That sounds perfect. Send over an updated proposal and timeline.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Account Manager>We'll have that to you by end of week. Let's schedule a follow-up for next Tuesday.
