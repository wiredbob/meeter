00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
<v Jordan Taylor>Morning team. Quick standup. I'll go first.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
<v Jordan Taylor>Yesterday I finished the authentication module. Today I'm starting on the API integration.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Pat Wilson>Nice work Jordan. I completed code review on three PRs yesterday.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Pat Wilson>Today I'm focusing on the database migration. Should be done by EOD.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Sam Lee>I'm blocked on the design assets. Can someone from design review the mockups?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Jordan Taylor>I'll ping the design team after this call.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Sam Lee>Thanks Jordan. That would be super helpful.
