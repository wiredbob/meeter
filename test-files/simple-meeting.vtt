00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Sarah Chen>Good morning everyone. Let's start with the Q1 roadmap discussion.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Mike Rodriguez>Thanks Sarah. I think we should prioritize Feature X for the March release.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Alex Kim>Agreed. We'll need to hire two additional engineers to hit that deadline.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Sarah Chen>Great point. Mike, can you draft the technical spec by Friday?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Mike Rodriguez>Absolutely. I'll have it ready by end of week.
